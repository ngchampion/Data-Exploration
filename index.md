# Exploration of Falcons within the United States
### Nathaniel Champion

## Introduction

The most interesting discovery I made since reviewing this dataset was just how prevalent falcons are in the United
States. It is also interesting to me about just how many different species of falcon there are, how some seem to be
migratory and they make their homes in almost any major biome including Alaskan tundra. Finally, falcons as a species
seem almost entirely unaffected by the human impact on the environment. 

## Dataset

This dataset is focused on cataloging the observances of multiple species of falcons within the United States. 

This data was produced by Global Biodiversity Information Facility. According to the GBIF website, www.GBIF.org
are a not for profit organization funded by multiple world governments that focuses on providing an open source of data 
about all life on earth from bacteria and protozoa to plant life and animal life. 

This data set is interesting to me as a falcon was my favorite animal growing up and now I can find out where in the 
United States I can go to see different types of falcons in the wild.


## Initial Questions

What initially drew me to this dataset aside from being about an animal that I find to be very cool. A peregrine falcon
can dive at speeds over 150 miles per hour. It will also be interesting to find out if any particular species of falcon 
is becoming endangered. If they migrate like other birds, or if their natural environment is being impacted by 
industrialization or any other human induced issue. 

The questions I would specifically like to answer with this dataset are: 

    Where in the United States do falcons live?
    Is the falcon population in the United States increasing, decreasing or maintaining?
    Are falcons negatively impacted by humans? 
    Do falcons migrate?

It never occurred to me that a bird of prey could be migratory until I started working the data set. With further 
research and looking through the data I've found that they can be, but it depends on the bird and region not every
falcon within a species will be migratory.  

Another interesting fact I learned from Encyclopedia Britannica is that falcon populations were hugely impacted 
after WWII. The suspected cause was pesticide infecting their food source. My data only goes back 20 years but 
matches the assertion that population numbers are rising and quickly. 

The data provided by GBIF.org is very nice in that it is uniform in nature and requires little if any modification
before use. Another reason this is great is due to the sheer size of the data set. 

## Discoveries & Insights

&nbsp;&nbsp;
As you can see from the above image there is a extremely large population of falcons throughout the United States.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
To further support this assertion of population growth this visualization shows a generally positive trend of 3 of 
the 5 falcon species types in the United States.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another type of graph that supports the explosive population growth of the falcons in the US is this one. Some of 
this data may be attributed to an increased number of observers in the more recent years but more than 1 million 
more sighting in the 2014-2019 period over 2000-2004 cannot be a result of only that. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this graph we can see that not only is there a general increase in the number of falcon sightings each year but
those sightings go noticeably higher in the Fall. I suspect that this increase is a result of the migratory nature
of some of the falcons which cause them to be observed and logged multiple times due to them traveling through 
multiple areas. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Image](/Map_Maryland.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this graph we can see a visual representation of the migratory nature of the Falco columbarius species of falcon.
This particular species with a few exceptions seems to leave the state of Maryland in the Summer months of June and 
July.

Finally, this extremely unique graph shows all of the hawk stands and other observation points observers log sightings
of falcons from. The bigger the circle the more observations made at that location. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;
## Conclusion

In conclusion, unlike some other species on the Earth falcons seem to be on the rise and are largely unaffected by 
the impact humans have had on their environment. They are abundant enough that they can be found in virtually every
biome in every state of the United States even in Alaska. I learned quite a bit about the current status of falcons
due to this data set and I hope I have shared some of that with you.
