Title
# Exploration of Falcons within the United States
### Nathaniel Champion

## Introduction

The most interesting discovery I made since reviewing this dataset was just how prevalent falcons are in the United
States. It is also interesting to me about just how many different species of falcon there are, how some seem to be
migratory and they make their homes in almost any major biome inclduing Alaskan tundra. Finally, falcons as a species
seem almost entirely unaffected by the human impact on the environment. 

## Dataset

This dataset is focused on cataloging the observances of multiple species of falcons within the United States. 

This data was produced by Global Biodeversity Information Facility. According to the GBIF website, www.GBIF.org
are a not for provide organization funded by multiple world governments that focuses on providing an open source of data 
about all life on earth from bacteria and protoza to plant life and animal life. 

This data set is interesting to me as a falcon was my favorite animal growing up and now I can find out where in the 
United States I can go to see different types of falcons in the wild.



## Initial Questions

What initially drew me to this dataset aside from being about an animal that I find to be very cool. A perigrine falcon
can dive at speeds over 150 miles per hour. It will also be interesting to find out if any particular species of falcon 
is becoming endangered. If they migrate like other birds, or if their natural environment is being impacted by 
industrialization or any other human induced issue. 

What questions I would specifically like to answer with this dataset are: 

    QUESTION 1
    QUESTION 2
    QUESTION 3
  
- What questions came up as you worked with the data? 
- Was there anything that surprised you about the data?
- Was it easy to work with or did you have to clean or "wrangle" the data?

## Discoveries & Insights

Images should be large and easy to see and interperate. 
Captions underneath should be 20-70 words long.
